                Our conviction in equity investment is founded on the belief
                that long-term participation in the equity markets yields
                substantial rewards. This in-depth analysis of multi-bagger
                stocks in India over the period from 2004 to 2024 underscores
                the remarkable returns generated by various companies over a
                two-decade horizon. It highlights the transformative potential
                of equities as a wealth creation vehicle, emphasizing the
                sustained value they can deliver to committed investors over
                extended timeframes.
